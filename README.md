Notes/what i have learned
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. evreything went well had somw trouble with putting as much and getting as much done as while learning as  i want to def working on this more after for myself 

Through this project, I learned the intricacies of designing and implementing a multi-feature SwiftUI application. I gained experience in structuring complex apps with interconnected views, managing user data with bindings, and ensuring a seamless user experience across different screens like login, marketplace, and wallet. Additionally, I explored the integration of features such as splash screens, cart functionality, and dynamic user summaries, all while adhering to a consistent design aesthetic. The challenges I faced included debugging scope-related errors, maintaining state consistency across multiple views, and ensuring smooth transitions between app components. These obstacles taught me the importance of thorough planning, iterative testing, and clear communication when managing complex project requirements. Ultimately, the project reinforced the value of resilience and problem-solving in software development.
